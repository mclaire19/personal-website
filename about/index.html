<h2 id="broadly">Broadly</h2>

<p>My main interests include data visualization, teaching and outreach in the data science community, and social policy. That said, I&rsquo;m a real nerd, and I tend to get excited about all manner of cool projects and topics. I find all forms of communication fascinating and important, and I believe very strongly that advanced data insights mean nothing if they can&rsquo;t be conveyed to the audiences who matter. If you want to learn more about my work, check out <a href="https://maddieclairepickens.com/projects/">projects I&rsquo;ve worked on</a>, my <a href="https://github.com/mclaire19">Github</a>, or my <a href="https://maddieclairepickens.com/posts/">blog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="more-specifically">More Specifically</h2>

<p>I graduated in May 2020 from the Georgetown McCourt School of Public Policy with an <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/master-of-science-in-data-science-for-public-policy/">M.S. in Data Science for Public Policy</a> - a relatively new degree that was designed to target the intersection of policy and data analytics. For a two-year program, they did an amazing job - we walked out with a healthy understand of R and Python, machine learning models (and their limitations!) and the uniqueness of working with data in the policy space. That said, I also walked out feeling incredibly overwhelmed by everything I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> know or understand. I&rsquo;ve been really grateful to the open source community, especially the RStats community, for providing free labor and content that lets me grow in my skills and understanding, and I&rsquo;m working to get to the point where I can contribute too.</p>

<p>I currently work as a data analyst at the <a href="https://www.usac.org/">Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)</a>, a nonprofit subsidiary of the FCC that oversees programs dedicated to improving broadband access in the US. In this job, I work with company-wide data to communicate insights and trends to executives via reports and ad hoc data pulls, using primarily R, SQL, and Tableau.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also currently a Teaching Assistant (TA) for a graduate-level <a href="http://ericdunford.com/ppol670/">introductory data science course</a> for MPP students. I previously worked as a TA for two semesters of graduate-level statistics, and created materials for a weekly recitation covering applications of the course material in R. I&rsquo;ve really loved these roles for letting me work with students and refine my own understanding of R; they inspired a few of my blog posts on Troubleshooting in R for Beginners and How to Google Your Errors.</p>

<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in school (and now quarantine) for so long that I&rsquo;m still working on figuring out hobbies. One thing that has stayed consistent is that I love reading anything and everything, from fantasy novels to autobiographies to, yes, technical discussions of data visualization software. I&rsquo;ve recently been dabbling in very bad watercolor and very beginner-level yoga. I own way too many mugs, but am always ready to buy one more.</p>
